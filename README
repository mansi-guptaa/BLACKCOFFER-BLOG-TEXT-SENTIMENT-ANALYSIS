## Sentimental Analysis

Sentimental analysis involves determining whether a piece of writing is positive, negative, or neutral. The methodology below is designed for use in financial texts and includes:

### Cleaning using Stop Words Lists

The Stop Words Lists (found in the folder `StopWords`) are used to clean the text by excluding words found in the stop words list. This helps in focusing on meaningful words for sentiment analysis.

### Creating Dictionary of Positive and Negative Words

The Master Dictionary (found in the folder `MasterDictionary`) is used to create dictionaries of positive and negative words. Only words not found in the stop words lists are added to these dictionaries.

### Extracting Derived Variables

Text is converted into a list of tokens using the `nltk` tokenize module. The following variables are calculated:

- **Positive Score**: The total count of words found in the Positive Dictionary, each assigned a value of +1.
- **Negative Score**: The total count of words found in the Negative Dictionary, each assigned a value of -1. The score is then multiplied by -1 to ensure a positive number.
- **Polarity Score**: Calculated using the formula:
  \[
  \text{Polarity Score} = \frac{\text{Positive Score} - \text{Negative Score}}{\text{Positive Score} + \text{Negative Score} + 0.000001}
  \]
  Range: -1 to +1
- **Subjectivity Score**: Calculated using the formula:
  \[
  \text{Subjectivity Score} = \frac{\text{Positive Score} + \text{Negative Score}}{\text{Total Words after cleaning} + 0.000001}
  \]
  Range: 0 to +1

## Analysis of Readability

Readability is calculated using the Gunning Fog Index with the following formulas:

- **Average Sentence Length** = Number of words / Number of sentences
- **Percentage of Complex Words** = Number of complex words / Number of words
- **Fog Index** = 0.4 * (Average Sentence Length + Percentage of Complex Words)

## Average Number of Words Per Sentence

Calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{Average Number of Words Per Sentence} = \frac{\text{Total Number of Words}}{\text{Total Number of Sentences}}
\]

## Complex Word Count

Complex words are defined as words with more than two syllables.

## Word Count

Total cleaned words are counted by:
1. Removing stop words (using `stopwords` class from `nltk` package).
2. Removing punctuations (e.g., `?`, `!`, `,`, `.`).

## Syllable Count Per Word

The number of syllables in each word is counted based on vowels. Exceptions, such as words ending in "es" or "ed," are handled appropriately.

## Personal Pronouns

Personal pronouns are identified using regex to count occurrences of "I," "we," "my," "ours," and "us," while excluding the country name "US."

## Average Word Length

Calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{Average Word Length} = \frac{\text{Sum of Total Number of Characters in Each Word}}{\text{Total Number of Words}}
\]

## Data Extraction and NLP

#### Objective

Extracted textual data from articles at given URLs and perform text analysis to compute the variables described below.

#### Data Extraction

- **Input File**: `Input.xlsx`
- Extracted text from articles, saving each in a text file named `URL_ID.txt`.
- Ensuring only the article title and text are extracted, excluding website headers, footers, etc.


#### Data Analysis

- Analyzed each extracted text according to the variables specified in `Output Data Structure.xlsx`.
- Output saved in `Output Data Structure.xlsx`.
